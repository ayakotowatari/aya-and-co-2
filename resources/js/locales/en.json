It was widely used in Japan until the mid 20th century when it was replaced by plastics. Nowadays, there is only one company specializing in Moku-men in Kochi Prefecture. Moku-men is considered to be beneficial for protecting forests in Japan as old trees need to be cut regularly to be replaced by new ones. Such old trees are used to produce moku-men.",
